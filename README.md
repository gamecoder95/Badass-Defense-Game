# Badass-Defense-Game
My first ever game project. The objective of the game is to defend your base from the onslaught of enemies using guns and power-ups that appear occasionally. You lose if the enemies reduce the health of the base down to zero; you win if you defend the base all ten rounds.
After each round, there is a shop in which you can purchase new weapons, heal your base, or fortify your base using money earned by
killing enemies.

Created with GameMaker 8.1 Lite in 2012-2013. This game was made entirely with the drag-and-drop elements of GameMaker.
